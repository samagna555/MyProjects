# MyProjects
I have created a .Net Core Web Api Application with MSTest Unittest Framework.
Please try to clone this project to your local folder (ex: C:\MyProjects\)
Once you clone it, Open the command line prompt and navigate to the local folder where you stored the project i.e (ex: ..\..\SamagnaSagamBVProj)
Now build the solution using the command 'dotnet build'
Once it builds successfully with 0 errors, which it should
Now run the solution using the command 'dotnet run'
It will say "Now listening on: https://localhost:5001" and "Now listening on: https://localhost:5000"
Choose either of the urls above in step 8, and paste in one of the browsers you have locally using "https://localhost:5001/home" or "https://localhost:5000/home"
Now you should see the results in descending order of count like "age:count"
